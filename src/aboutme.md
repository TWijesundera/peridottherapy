Hi, I’m Victoria! I believe you know yourself better than anyone else.
I’m not here to give advice or tell you what to do - I’m here to support you,
reflect with you, and help you move through what you’re working on, at your own pace.

I graduated from Michigan School of Psychology with my
Master of Arts in Clinical Psychology
in August of 2025 and am practicing with my TLLP (Temporary Limited License Psychologist).
During my Master’s program, I interned at the Michigan School of Psychology’s clinic,
working directly with adults of all ages.
